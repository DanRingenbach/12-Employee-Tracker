# 12-Employee-Tracker

## Description
For this project I created a command line application that allows the user to view and edit a database of employees that includes information on their roles and the departments that include those roles.  I used *Inquirer* npm to prompt the user in the terminal.  *MySQL* connects the user to the database.  *console.table* was used to display the data nicely in the terminal.
